# James Hoover, Product Designer
https://jameshoover.github.io/

I am an accomplished product designer with a decade of experience in the tech industry.

The majority of my career has been spent at startups as the sole designer. This has given me the opportunity to be very close to the product and learn in realtime how my decisions effect the company as a whole. From this I’ve built a deep understanding of the product lifecycle and gained the experience to make decisions proven to contribute to user growth and retention.

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is creating a successful product does not stop at designing for your user’s needs. You must also design for your organization because products that are easier to build and sell will find more success in this fast paced and competitive market.
