					<!-- <p>I’m James Hoover, a product designer from Seattle.</p> -->
					<p>With a decade of experience designing products from idea to production, I have a proven ability to contribute to the success of any product.</p>
					<p>My experience spans a range of industries, from machine learning to real estate (and a few years as a software developer), enabling me to approach product design from a broad perspective. Paired with the privilege of working with a diverse set of teams, I'm capable of collaborating cross-functionally to translate even the most complex and technical product requirements into a user-friendly and intuitive interface.</p>
					<p class="margin__bot_2">I've found success in my career because engineers and designers speak different languages. With my background in software development, I am able to bridge the gap and work directly with engineering, not only ensuring my designs are built correctly but ensuring they are easy to build. This is one of the most important lessons I've learned in my career, that designing the best experience should not be limited to the user. It must extend to colleagues because the easier a product is to build, maintain, and sell, the more success it will find in this competitive, fast paced market.</p>
